# Tyler Bloom's Portfolio ðŸ“ƒ

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, showcasing my professional milestones, projects, and current endeavors.

## About

This Single Page Application (SPA) portfolio is built using the MERN stack for initial development and testing. It has been transitioned to utilize AWS services, including API Gateway and Lambda functions to fetch data from an S3 bucket. The website features a responsive design and interactive UI components, highlighting my work as a Software Engineer.

- **Interactive UI:** Smooth scrolling and animations using `react-scroll` and `framer-motion`.
- **Project Showcase:** Detailed sections highlighting my GitHub projects and professional milestones.
- **AWS Integration:** Hosted on AWS with data retrieval through AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions.
- **Form Validations:** A single form with implemented form validations.
- **Secure Setup:** CloudFront distribution with Origin Access Control (OAC) for secure S3 bucket access.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, TypeScript, react-scroll, framer-motion, FontAwesome
- **Backend:** AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, S3 Bucket, JSON files
